# Abstract 
This project is Zhaohong Jin's research project at [Harvard's Visual Computing Group](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/) Lab supervised by [Professor Hanspeter Pfister](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/people) and [Donglai Wei, PhD](https://donglaiw.github.io/). It is primarily concerned with studying how to re-construct 3D shaped neurons from Electron Microscope(EM) or Computed Tomography(CT) scanned images of brain tissues. Traditionally, this is done through semantic analysis where deep learning approaches(such as 3D Unet) predicts which class each pixel of the image belongs to. EM generated images have better qualities at the cost of time and computation power (EM only looks at a small region of the brain). CT based approaches are more scalable at the cost of low image quality. In this project, we are exploring a way to re-construct 3D shapd neurons from low quality CT images by combining semantic segmentation with a global prior on the neuron shape to fix prediction errors. This means large 3D re-construction at scale is possible.
